      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Isabel and I am currently a student at Coding Temple. I reside in Dallas, TX but I grew up in
        Louisiana. When I am not coding, I love to spend some time in my kitchen and cook exciting dishes. I also enjoy
        traveling to new places around the world. Here are a few pictures of my
        travels:

      <h3>Why Web Development?</h3>
      <p>
        I've always been interested in technology but never thought I was smart enough to pursue a career in tech. In
        college, I went on the path of psychology and eventually received my Master's in Industrial /
        Organizational Psychology. After graduation, I worked in the recruitment industry and for the past 5 years I
        have worked as a research associate. I felt secure at my job but I was never challenged. Over 3 years ago, I
        looked into coding and knew the possibilities were limitless. At first I started with online learning and then
        luckily found some people to pair-program with. I learned a great amount from those individuals and gained a lot
        of confidence after 2 years. I soon realized that I had waited long enough to make a change and I decided to
        enroll in Coding Temple to begin my new career path.
